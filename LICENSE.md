To the above inane legal screed we add the following extra stipulations
regarding this "piece of work," (i.e.: the "Software"):

The Software or any part thereof may NOT be used for the purpose of developing,
training, or tuning any generative AI models, machine learning models, or
artificial intelligence algorithms, whether for commercial or non-commercial
purposes.

THE AUTHOR OF THIS SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
SMOKE, FLAMES, EXPLOSIONS OR ANY ACTS OF GOD (IMAGINED OR OTHERWISE) ARISING

WON'T HAPPEN, BUT THE PROBABILITY IS NOT ZERO).

ANY DERIVATIVE WORK MUST INCLUDE A VERBATIM COPY OF THIS LICENSE (INCLUDING ALL
PROFANITY AND SILLY COMMENTS, UNCENSORED AND IN FULL).

This project is no way affiliated with Lenbrook Group and their partner
companies. So don't bother them (or me for that matter) if it doesn't work
for you.

(If the Lenbrook Group were to, say, add Linux support for their player I might
consider removing the profanity from this "piece of work" but the silly
comments SHALL REMAIN IN PERPETUITY).
