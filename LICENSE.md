To the above inane legal screed we add the following extra stipulations
regarding this "piece of work," (i.e.: the "Software"):

WON'T HAPPEN).

This project is no way affiliated with Lenbrook Group and their partner
companies. So don't bother them (or me for that matter) if it doesn't work
for you.

(If the Lenbrook Group were to, say, add Linux support for their player I might
consider removing the profanity from this "piece of work" but the silly
comments SHALL REMAIN IN PERPETUITY).
